# AirlineReservationSystem
An airline/flight reservation system using C++ with basic data structure (Linked list, basic use of stack) and OOP.
It has the basic inputs like name, passport ID, destination, payment method and more.

The search uses the email entered by the user to search for all the flights he reserved and will save all his information.
More user friendly than average and highly customizable and easy to add more destinations or options in general.
